# grc-sql-risk-monitoring
# Financial Crime Risk & Compliance Analysis (SQLite)

## 🔍 Overview
A simulated SQL-based GRC project focused on analyzing customer transactions, alerts, and risk rules. Includes data based on FATF and OFAC sanction lists.

This project was born out of my broader interest in all things GRC. Financial Crimes, KYC, and AML are newer areas for me, and I saw this as a way to both deepen my understanding and demonstrate how I approach risk through a practical, data-driven lens.

## 📂 What's Inside
- `compliance_db.sqlite`: SQLite database with fake financial data
- `queries/`: Contains SQL for KPIs and KCIs
- `docs/`: Schema diagrams and rule documentation

## 🚀 Features
- Risk scoring by severity and transaction patterns
- Alerts from sanctioned countries
- Compliance-focused control checks (KCIs)

## 🧠 Next Steps
- Build a Power BI dashboard from key queries
- Add audit logs and follow-up tracking
- Add SQL clauses for alert triggers
- Link monitoring to specific NIST/ISO Controls
- Create procedures for remediation
